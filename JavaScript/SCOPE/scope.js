//Scope in JavaScript defines where variables and functions 
// can be accessed in your code. 
// It determines the visibility and lifetime of variables.
//  There are three main types of scope in JavaScript:





//Key Take aways 


//Global Scope : Accessible everywhere

// Function Scope : Accessible only inside the function

//Block Scope : let and const are block-scoped, but var is not.

//Lexical Scope : Inner function can access variable from outer functions

//Closures : Functions retain access to their outer scope variables.
